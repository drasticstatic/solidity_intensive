## ⚠ FIRST: sync this clone before you touch anything

```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash
```

Run this at the **start of every session**, before reading deeply or editing. Several agents and
Christopher push to these repos — including Cosmos agents that run unattended while nobody is at the
machine — so a clone can be behind by the time you open it.

**`--autostash` is what makes this safe on a dirty tree.** It stashes uncommitted changes, rebases
onto the remote, then reapplies them. Your in-progress work survives. Without it, `git pull --rebase`
refuses to run and you are tempted into something worse.

Why it matters more than it sounds:

- A stale clone **does not fail early.** It fails at push time, after the work is done, as a
  non-fast-forward rejection — the most expensive moment to discover it.
- The tempting fix at that point is `git push --force`, which discards whatever someone else pushed
  in the meantime. Syncing first removes the temptation.
- If a rebase does conflict, stop and resolve it deliberately. A conflict is information: someone
  else changed the same lines, and you want to know that *before* building on top of them.

**Fresh clone?** Also run `sh scripts/install-hooks.sh` — git hooks are not version-controlled, so
the commit-attribution hook stays inert until this clone is pointed at `.githooks/`. Details:
[`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Agent Ecosystem

| Agent | Platform | Domain |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Alfred** | Claude Code CLI | Primary coordinator — cross-repo housekeeping, free-model sandbox, generalist tasks (default) |
| **Fortuna** | Claude Code CLI | Trading specialist — trading workflow, session analysis, coaching documentation (designated domain) |
| **Kavanah** | Augment Intent | Spec-driven orchestration specialist — cross-repo coordination, documentation |
| **Auggie** | Augment CLI | Code build specialist — Pine Script, Python, MCP servers, web3/dappu |

## This Repo

**Purpose:** DAppU Solidity Intensive class project — advanced Solidity patterns and security practices.

**Status:** Inactive. Christopher is not actively working on this repo.

**When Active:** Auggie leads code builds. Fortuna provides trading context if relevant. Kavanah handles spec-driven orchestration. Alfred handles cross-repo housekeeping.

## Security Rules

- Never read, display, or reference `.env` files
- Never read private keys, seed phrases, wallet files, or API key files
- Never commit secrets — warn and stop if staged
- Before cloning/installing any external repo: review package.json scripts, scan for credential harvesting, verify provenance, check for typosquatting, audit network calls

---

## Cross-Repo Rules

See `AGENT-SYNC/CROSS_REPO_RULES.md` in `trading-assistant` for full governance.

## Commit attribution (enforced by hook)

Every commit must carry two git trailers:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Provider> [<Model>]                  # direct
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Gateway> · <Provider> [<Model>]      # proxied
<Platform>-Session: <full session URL>
```

Model in **square brackets**, separator is U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT ( · ). Add `<Gateway>` **only when
inference is proxied** — it names what *routed* the request (`NVIDIA NIM`, `OpenRouter`), never who
made the model (`Z.ai`, `Moonshot AI`, `MiniMaxAI`). The field order mirrors the `/model` selector
string, so `anthropic/nvidia_nim/z-ai/glm4.7` transcribes to `NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]` —
read it left to right rather than memorising it. Local runtimes (`Ollama`, `llama.cpp`,
`LM Studio`) have no gateway: the weights ran on your machine, so the runtime is the Provider. The session
trailer is a **separate** line — folding it onto the `Co-Authored-By:` line breaks git trailer
parsing. Use the full session URL, never a truncated prefix. Key varies by platform:
`Claude-Session:` for Claude Code CLI, `Cosmos-Session:` for Cosmos.

`.githooks/commit-msg` rejects non-conforming commits. **Activate it once per clone:**

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Human-only commits: `git commit --no-verify`. **Canonical spec — single source of truth. Do not restate the field table locally; link it:**
